### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rafael, a software engineer from Brazil. For the last 4.5 years I have been working as a FullStack developer building server with Django/Python and apps with React/React Native. Previously CTO of Moodar, a brazilian startup improving mental health for people/companies, since the end of last year I decided to make a shift in my career and look for jobs outside Brazil to fulfill my dream of living abroad in the future.

Recently, I have started focusing on Frontend and it is where I'm looking for a job opportunity now. I have been studying and building some personal projects with React and Typescript to deepen my knowledge in these technologies and specialize me as a Frontend. In the beginning of January, I also started posting some articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/carlosrafael22) for me to share what I learned hoping it can be helpful for other developers as well.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Forminho](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/forminho) and building some small study projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React/Typescript/Styled-Components/Storybook/RTL and building [Won-frontend](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/won-frontend) from classes taught by [Willian Justen](https://github.com/willianjusten). Things coming up in my studies are Next.JS, GraphQL and Strapi, all covered in the course.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source and that's also why I started [Forminho](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/forminho). Hopefully, in the future, it can help developers to make simple forms more easily.
