### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rafael, a software engineer from Brazil. For the last 4/5 years I have been working as a FullStack developer building server with Django/Python and apps with React/React Native. Previously CTO of Moodar, a brazilian startup leading with mental health for people/companies, since the end of last year I decided to make a shift in my career and look for jobs outside Brazil to fulfill my dream of living abroad in the future.

Recently, I have started focusing on Frontend and it is where I'm looking for a job opportunity now. I have been studying and building some personal projects with React and Typescript to deepen my knowledge in the technology and specialize me as a Frontend. In beginning of January, I also started posting some articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/carlosrafael22) for me to share what I learned hoping it can be helpful for other developers as well.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Forminho](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/forminho) and building some small study projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React/Typescript and building [Won-frontend](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/won-frontend) from classes taught by [Willian Justen](https://github.com/willianjusten).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source and that's why I started [Forminho](https://github.com/CarlosRafael22/forminho) hoping that I can publish it in the future and help developers to make simple forms more easily.

That's it! Hope you know a bit more about me if you come across my profile :)
